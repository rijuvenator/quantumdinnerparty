        <h1>The Dinner Party</h1>
        <br>

<p class=paragraph>
During my sabbatical it had become somewhat of a tradition for me to host an occasional dinner party for a few of my university colleagues.

You see, in my youth, I had read <span class=rnd id=inspire>H. G. Wells’s <span class=oeuvre>The Time Machine</span></span>, and had never fully freed my mind of the idea that dinner parties are breeding grounds for interesting events.
Besides, our tendency to be accompanied by a penchant for adorning impassioned monologues with what was often viewed as insufferable pedantry meant that casual invitations to soirées occurred with an infrequency inconsistent with our appetite for cocktails and conversation. 

<p class=paragraph>
<span class=rnd id=months>Despite it being late October, the autumn had thus far been unusually warm, and the air had only recently acquired its characteristically crisp chill</span>, and so I had opted to seat and serve my <span class=rnd id=nguests>twelve</span> guests, a motley collection of professors and a sprinkling of their voluntary serfs, <span class=rnd id=where>on my deck</span>.
The dinner itself was delicious, seasoned with casual conversation, but otherwise relatively uneventful.
I believe my guests had thoroughly enjoyed their meal, which had been <span class=rnd id=food>hearty fare consisting of a tribute to the art of the roast, meat and vegetables alike.
The cheese biscuits</span> were particularly popular, their attentive presence on my party trays having been exhaustively replaced by compliments.

<p class=paragraph>
As the evening progressed, I suggested to the group that we retire to the library, which was well-stocked with books to spark discussion, games to fuel the imagination, and liquor to lubricate it.
In short (though brevity is rarely my forte), it was an academic’s playground; my colleagues fell upon it like toddlers in a sandbox.

It should surprise no one, therefore, that little time had passed before the air crackled with the warm murmur of engaging conversation.
For a time, I floated amongst the group, ghostly, my spectral presence welcomed as it was accompanied by offers to replenish their spirits.


<p class=paragraph>
I soon grew aware of a more spirited argument.

<p class=paragraph>
“I simply don’t believe that element of randomness,”
said a historian, waving one hand dismissively.
“Surely omniscience implies absolute determinism.
Just because we can’t predict the future, doesn’t mean it’s fundamentally impossible.
‘God does not play dice with the universe,’ and all that, eh?”
He looked around for validation of his cleverness and was satisfied by a few polite smiles.

<p class=paragraph>
“It doesn’t matter what you believe,” protested a statistician.
“The universe simply works this way: fundamentally stochastic.”
She waved her own hand emphatically, determined to defend to the death the dogma of data.

<p class=paragraph>
“Why, then, surely it should matter <span class=emph>more</span> what we believe; by your own admission, my beliefs are not pre-determined, so my thoughts must be my own!” interjected a professor of classics.

<p class=paragraph>
“It would also imply that decision-making is fundamentally unpredictable,” argued an ethics professor.
“And that would imply that there is an intrinsic randomness to human behavior.
You would then argue that there is an objective underpinning to morality!
Do you claim to have mathematical answers to humanity’s deepest questions about morality and free will?”
His expression remained friendly and his manner inquisitive, though he pronounced <span class=emph>mathematical</span> in a tone that one could almost describe as laced with contempt.

<p class=paragraph>
“Drawing that conclusion would require some unsubstantiated claims about consciousness,” cautioned a psychology professor.
No stranger to casual banter about human behavior, she sipped something <span class=rnd id=liquorcolor>cloudy</span> from a rocks glass with a mild expression on her face.

<p class=paragraph>
… Had I given her that?
I didn’t think I stocked <span class=rnd id=liquorcolor2>cloudy</span> liquor.

<p class=paragraph>
“Perhaps this all comes down to whether life is a chess game?” started a mathematics professor brightly, interrupting my thoughts and looking up from a game he was playing with another mathematician, and everyone groaned.

<p class=paragraph>
“You think everything is a game,” someone grumbled.

<p class=paragraph>
“Humor me,” he said, somewhat reproachfully, and continued.
“It is said that every chess game is unique.
The uninitiated may believe that this suggests an element of chance in the game.
But mathematically, there are only so many possible arrangements of the pieces.
Every chess game is different only because there are so many arrangements as to be unfathomable by humans.
Nevertheless, if you could just look up every possible game, out of the billions upon billions of games, then all outcomes would be set in stone, and there would be no element of chance.
Every possibility would be as black and white as… well, this chessboard.
But any game governed by dice rolls, for example, has the potential to be completely unpredictable.
No matter how much you planned and plotted and researched, the results could only be stated in terms of probability.
If the universe is a chess game, it is deterministic, and though its many branching possibilities may be too great for us to comprehend, a being with vast knowledge would understand it all.
But if the universe is chaotic at its very heart, then an exact prediction is, in essence, unknowable.”
As he finished, he confidently picked up a <span class=rnd id=chess>knight</span> and moved it across the board.
His opponent grinned and tipped over his king.

<p class=paragraph>
“That’s exactly what she’s saying,” said a computer scientist pleasantly.
“Chess is deterministic because you have perfect information. 
The theoretical dice you describe are perfectly random.
In the real world, one can’t have perfect information.
If you knew everything about real, physical, dice, you could predict how they’d land, and it would no longer be random.”

<p class=paragraph>
“More than that,” interrupted the statistician, “it’s theoretically impossible to know all of that information.
I think there’s some physics argument for it.”

<p class=paragraph>
“Then why do we engage in idle speculation,” asked a bemused logician, “when an expert walks in our midst?”
The room resonated with a few good-natured chuckles as attention fell upon the physicist.

<p class=paragraph>
He stared pensively <span class=rnd id=lightsource>into the fireplace</span>, smoking silently.

<p class=paragraph>
Of course, he was not actually smoking (that would be absurd), but he took up a moody demeanor that was expected, perhaps even relished by his eager colleagues.
He had a role to play, after all, as a mystic, shedding light upon the mysteries of the universe.
The timeless imagery of the brooding professor, bespectacled, be-tweeded, and piped, smoking thoughtfully as the warm glow of <span class=rnd id=lightsource2>firelight</span> illuminates half his face to illustrate the soft yet pronounced lines of the dichotomy he ponders, was hard-won and not easily relinquished.
So I say he is smoking, much as T. H. White says they are drinking port in the opening pages of <span class=oeuvre>The Once and Future King</span>. That, at least, was intended to be a deterministic literary communication between myself and you, hence my explicit fourth-wall breaking to guarantee its transmission.

<p class=paragraph>
“It is difficult,” he began dramatically, and as if on cue, the billiard players looked up from their pool ball pyramid, eager to partake in the forthcoming symphony of rhetoric.
“It is difficult to conceive of an everyday experience which makes apparent the inherently probabilistic nature of things.
Far more attractive, especially for us, is the notion that, equipped with perfect knowledge, one can predict the future.
Nevertheless, scientific observations indicate that this kind of perfect knowledge is unattainable, in a certain restricted sense.
Why, then, do we feel as though the workings of the universe seem to obey rules and patterns?”

<p class=paragraph>
He paused briefly, and most of the room was listening (although there was a pair of ethnomusicologists in a corner continuing to discuss the finer points of the mathematical underpinning of sounds that are cross-culturally found to be harmonious to the human ear).

<p class=paragraph>
“It seems that the chaotic, probabilistic world of the microscopic smooths out into a more orderly universe.
Furthermore, things are only probabilistic in an ensemble sense, in that if you set up many identical copies of a situation and repeated them, the probability is related to the fraction of ensembles that…”

<p class=paragraph>
He trailed off as he noticed a few eyes beginning to glaze over.
(Though I sincerely hope that my liquor cabinet was at least partially to blame for this.)

<p class=paragraph>
“All right, perhaps it would be better to illustrate with a thought experiment.”

<p class=paragraph>
“Consider this dinner party.
Imagine that various minor details about this party — the time, the food, the number of people, and so on — could differ.
This particular instance of the dinner party has some specific, concrete details.
But if you could reset this dinner party, over and over, you might see some things change, and some of those changes might happen more often than others.
That’s all that’s meant by probabilistic, really.
And maybe some of the big things don’t change at all.
Maybe we have this argument about determinism every time.
So you could say that the overall trajectory of this dinner party is about the same, even if some of the minor details change.
That’s how the seemingly random fluctuations at the small scale average out into a large world whose motions seem determinable with enough information.”
He paused again and looked around at his audience.

<p class=paragraph>
“Does that mean that physics says determinism is impossible?
If everything is only apparently deterministic, but fundamentally statistical at the small scale, then it seems like it would be impossible,” asked the psychologist.

<p class=paragraph>
“Physics doesn’t say determinism is impossible.
It just makes determinism harder to exist, because determinism by means of knowing everything about something at the same time is impossible,” replied the physicist.

<p class=paragraph>
The party digested this rather confusing pronouncement for a few moments as everyone tried to determine whose side of the argument physics was on, or whether physics was on anyone’s side at all.

<p class=paragraph>
“That was not entirely satisfying,” said the logician, finally.

<p class=paragraph>
“Well, what else did you expect from a physicist?
You ask a direct question and they answer with thought experiments and caveats.
His is the field that invented spherical cows, after all,” joked the mathematician, and several people laughed, including the physicist.

<p class=paragraph>
“I found it enlightening,” beamed the statistician, and there was a general murmur of agreement.

<p class=paragraph>
After another hour or so, having had their fill of both food and philosophy, my guests began to trickle out into the night, one by one, and I saw them off at my front door as they thanked me for excellent food and company. 
Among the last to leave was the physicist.
We stood in my Victorian archway, neither indoors nor out.

<p class=paragraph>
“I enjoyed it very much,” I said of his thought-provoking discourse.
“Though I must admit, I couldn’t make heads or tails of it all.”

<p class=paragraph>
“That,” he said as he reached into his pocket, “is precisely the point. Perhaps you understood it better than anyone else.”
He lifted his hand; between his fingers was a single silvery quarter.
He flipped the coin into the air, which made a pleasant <span class=emph>ting</span> as it arced above our heads before he caught it deftly, slapped it on his forearm, and covered it with his palm.

<p class=paragraph>
“Would you believe me if I said this was an entangled quarter?”

<p class=paragraph>
“I have no idea what that means.”

<p class=paragraph>
“Never mind. Just call it.” He observed me expectantly.

<p class=paragraph>
“All right, <span class=rnd id=called>heads then. We’ve certainly had</span> a lot of interesting ones here tonight.”

<p class=paragraph>
He moved his palm.

<p class=paragraph>
<span class=rnd id=coin>Tails</span>.

<p class=paragraph>
He smiled mysteriously.

<p class=paragraph>
“Good night, and thank you again,” and he walked off into the darkness, leaving me with only the soft sounds of the night and my own thoughts.
